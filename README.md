# Mapping_Earthquakes


Purpose: The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

We will display the magnitude and location of the earthquake on a popup marker on our final map. The diameter of each map marker will correspond to the magnitude, size, and color of the earthquake. Earthquakes with larger magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color, with a legend providing context for the map data. Finally, to illustrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, we would add faultlines on the map. At the end of the project, we would have implemented visualization that is aesthetically pleasing and interactive.

To complete this project, we would use URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data, and GeoJSON major earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We would also use a URL to map tectomic plates, and finally we would add the data to a map.
